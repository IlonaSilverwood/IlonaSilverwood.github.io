I'm Ilona, a strength and conditioning coach with an old political science degree and a new interest in technical writing and software development. On the surface, coaching athletes seemed very different from technical writing, but I've been truly surprised by the similarities I've found so far.\n\nThis Quarto website will track my learning journey with technical writing and basic programming. I'm currently working on using GitHub effectively and building this site using Quarto, as well as doing a Programming for Writers course on Udemy to learn basic concepts and terminology. In the long term, this website and the associated GitHub account will  host a portfolio containing examples of whitepapers, API documentation, and procedural documents (among others). \n\nTo help with the learning process, I'm also going to be writing about topics I'm very familiar with in order to be able to focus on learning my way around GitHub and Quarto. The [Strength Training Guides](training%20guides.qmd) section is an opportunity for me to use coaching content to explore how to upload and link content.\n\n\nBA, Political Science  \nUniversity of British Columbia\n\n# Languages\n\nFluent: English, Hungarian  \nConversational: Spanish\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"cosmo","title":"Ilona Silverwood","about":{"template":"jolla","image":"Rollo.jpg"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
