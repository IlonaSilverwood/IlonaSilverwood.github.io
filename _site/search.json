In the long term, this website and the associated GitHub account will host a portfolio containing examples of whitepapers, API documentation, and procedural documents (among others).\nTo help with the learning process, I’m also going to be writing about topics I’m very familiar with in order to be able to focus on learning my way around GitHub and Quarto.

    "text": "Bracing is the act of stiffening the muscles that make up your abdominal wall. It is neither pulling your abs in (also called hollowing), nor actively pushing them out. Your goal is to contract the muscles in order to enhance spinal stability.\n\n\nAn appropriate amount of abdominal stiffness enhances athletic performance by:\n\nAllowing a greater load to be lifted.\nEliminating spinal movement that could result in discomfort.\nIncreasing speed and force generation at the shoulder and hip.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent situations call for different levels of stiffness through the abdominal wall. A near-max lift will require a much stronger brace than a lighter lift. You should be matching the intensity of the brace to the given activity, generating enough stiffness to ensure that the added load will not result in unnecessary torso movement during the activity.\n\n\n\nDeveloping the muscle control necessary to create abdominal stiffness might require practice. The following steps will allow you to practice finding the appropriate muscular pattern:\n\nStand upright, in a neutral position. Do not let your shoulders or head fall forward.\nPlace your thumbs on your spinal extensors near the curve of your lower back.\nWrap fingers around your sides, towards your belly button.\nWithout moving, stiffen your abdominal muscles until you feel the muscles in both the front and back stiffen.\n\nIf this feels foreign, practice with other limbs first.\n\nLet your arm hang straight at your side.\nContract your bicep and tricep at the same time.\nNote the difference in how the area feels, despite the lack of movement at the shoulder or elbow."

    "text": "Why hip hinging is important\nThe hips are designed to produce force, while the spine is not. Effective strength training requires us to generate force using the hips, while the lower back stays in a relatively fixed position due to an appropriate [brace]. It is important to be able to differentiate between movement at the hip and the lower back for several reasons:\n\nincrease the amount of load you can lift safely\nreduce risk of low back discomfort\nincrease [hip extensor muscle] strength\nencourage hypertrophy in hip extensors"

    "text": "When to hip hinge\nEvery compound lower body movement requires some degree of hip hinging. Some movements, for example a [Romanian deadlift], are entirely hip hinge based. Others, like a [squat] or [lunge], require a combination of hip hinging and [knee flexion]. The degree of hip movement relative to knee movement in a given exercise may change depending on:\n\nthe variation you are performing\nyour individual anatomy and preference\nyour training goals"

    "text": "How to hip hinge\nHip hinging may feel foreign at first, and it might be challenging to feel the difference between bending at the hip and bending at the lower back. Monitoring your movement by recording yourself or using your hands to feel what your back and hips are doing will help you learn the hip hinge pattern. To get started, try the following drill:\n\nStand upright, in a [neutral position].\n[Brace] abdominal wall.\nPlace one palm on your stomach and the other on your lower back.\nMaintain the abdominal brace as you push your hips back.\n\nNOTE: pay attention to your hands. If you feel your torso bending forward, reset the movement and try again.\n\nOnce you have reached your maximum range of motion, keep your torso still as your hips push forward to standing upright.\n\nNOTE: End range of motion is the point where you cannot move the hips back any more without bending at the spine."
