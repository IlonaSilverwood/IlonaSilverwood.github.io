# Bracing

Bracing is the act of stiffening the muscles that make up your abdominal wall. It is neither pulling your abs in (also called hollowing), nor actively pushing them out. Your goal is to contract the muscles in order to enhance spinal stability. 


## Why bracing is important

An appropriate amount of abdominal stiffness enhances athletic performance by: 

* Allowing a greater load to be lifted.
* Eliminating spinal movement that could result in discomfort.
* Increasing speed and force generation at the shoulder and hip.


## When to brace

Different situations call for different levels of stiffness through the abdominal wall. A near-max lift will require a much stronger brace than a lighter lift. You should be matching the intensity of the brace to the given activity, generating enough stiffness to ensure that the added load will not result in unnecessary torso movement during the activity.



## How to brace

Developing the muscle control necessary to create abdominal stiffness might require practice. The following steps will allow you to practice finding the appropriate muscular pattern:

1. Stand upright, in a neutral position. Do not let your shoulders or head fall forward.
2. Place your thumbs on your spinal extensors near the curve of your lower back.
3. Wrap fingers around your sides, towards your belly button.
4. Without moving, stiffen your abdominal muscles until you feel the muscles in both the front and back stiffen.

If this feels foreign, practice with other limbs first. 

1. Let your arm hang straight at your side.
2. Contract your bicep and tricep at the same time.
3. Note the difference in how the area feels, despite the lack of movement at the shoulder or elbow.
